Dose is a terminal application written in python, designed for medication tracking and harm reduction (android apk under construction as well)

Dose logs are stored in a CSV file that includes data such as the standard chemical name, brand name, numerical dose (e.g 10,15,25, etc), unit type (mg, G, ug, etc) and a timestamp.
